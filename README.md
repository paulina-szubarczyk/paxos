# Paxos

Simple paxos implementation. Consensus algorithm for a single value.

Note: The work is still in progress, to start the algorithm all nodes must be running
      and successfully connect to each other before timeout expiration.

# Dependencies

Poco library: https://pocoproject.org/

Protobuf: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview

Google test/mock: configured as external project, downloadable on configuration

# Usage:
Starting single node instantion:
./Paxos json_network_config_file instantion_node_name

Example:

./Paxos ../config/network_topology.json node1

./Paxos ../config/network_topology.json node2

./Paxos ../config/network_topology.json node3
...

# Config
Configuration of network must be described in a json file.
Required fields:
- num_of_nodes
- seed_name 
- node, as list of nodes

Node structure requires:
- name
- ip
- port


Example:
```json
{
    "num_of_nodes" : 3,
    "seed_name" : "node1",
    "node" :
    [
        {
            "name" : "node1",
            "ip" : "127.0.0.1",
            "port" : 6170
        },
        {
            "name" : "node2",
            "ip" : "127.0.0.1",
            "port" : 6180
        },
        {
            "name" : "node3",
            "ip" : "127.0.0.1",
            "port" : 6190
        }
    ]
}
```
